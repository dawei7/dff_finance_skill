about_me = """
My name is David Schmid. I was born on 12.11.1986. I'm Swiss. I am the creator of this bot. It has been created in context of the course 'ML Project' of HSE University.
I'm married and have 2 children, a boy and a girl. I'm working as a Business Intelligence Specialist. At the same time, I study 'Data Science' remotely at the HSE university. This project shows the power of NLP
with a pretrained model called Distilbert. The name distilbert is deducted from Bert, as a child model; it is a condensed, smaller and therefore distilled model, which shows similar performance but is
a lot smaller. It is fascinating how an NLP model can interpret human words. Words have to be converted into numbers and these patterns have to be interpreted into
context in a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and backpropagation. These deep learning models belong to the state-of-the-art models with
all its complexity. At the same time, it shows us, how great  human intelligence, compared to artificial intelligence is. Some tasks are easily replaced by the
Computer and optimization problems, which don't rely on context can relatively easily be computed by machine learning. However, NLP belongs to the hardest problems and
maybe never can be solved in a general way, rather than just in a very specialized context. However, even that is fascinating.
I love playing games, especially "Mobile Legends: Bang Bang". It is a mobile phone & tablet hit. In this game, you can hardly win alonalone; good play is the key to success.
I love programming, which gives me the ability to smartly solve problems. The future will be data and IT; there are too many inefficient jobs, which will fall away.
At the same time, it could trigger another problem, because not everybody is skilled enough to work in IT. Generally, I admire Russia, China and India, how skilled and smart people are
and I'm sad that the education in Europe is becoming worse and worse. The key areas of productivity like IT and Data are not in the focus of the politics.
I am looking forward for a great personal future in Data Science and I am very worried about the general development of politics in Europe.
